How to add a manpage to the system (assuming your manpage text file is located in ~/Desktop):

cd /usr/share/man/man1
sudo cp ~/Desktop/mymanpage mymanpage.1
sudo chmod 0644 mymanpage.1
man mymanpage

Note: replace "mymanpage" with the name of the text file that will be your manpage.
Follow the ".1" convention as directed by the commands above. Otherwise, the manpage will not
properly register with the man command.

If man is not able to find the manpage you added to /usr/share/man/man1, you may need to
add that directory to the man search path. You may do so in this file: /etc/man.config
