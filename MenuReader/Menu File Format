Sample menu file format:
Item #1 Name
item1.sh
This is the description for item #1. It may
span several lines. To end the definition for an item, simply
enter a blank new line after the description.

Item #2 Name

Descrip. Item #2--Notice that you may leave a blank line after
the name of a menu item if there is no executable or script associated with it.
The line dedicated to an associated executable name is the only definition
for a menu item that may be left blank. Otherwise, formatting errors will occur.
